### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[I am a technical leader, speaker and author.](https://cs-syd.eu/cv)
I specialise in highly robust, _ethically sustainable_ software and [self-managament](https://cs-syd.eu/self-management).

All my software is ethically sustainable: open-source, self-hostable, offline-first, api-second, cli-third and web-whenever.

Nowadays I spend my coding time working on [Smos](https://smos.cs-syd.eu)
